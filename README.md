  Welcome to My Portfolio 
</h3>

This repository is dedicated to showcasing the projects I've worked on as a **Full-Stack Developer** over the past 4+ years. 🚀

## About Me

Throughout my career, I’ve had the privilege of contributing to a variety of projects, building both **frontend**, **backend** and **database** solutions. Some of these projects are under NDA, so I’m unable to share them publicly. However, I’ve shared most of my work here, and I plan to keep adding more projects and blog posts in the future. 🌱

## Blog Posts ✍️

This repository also serves as a space to maintain blog posts about the technologies I use and love. As a developer, I believe in continuous learning and sharing knowledge. My blog will cover topics such as:

- **Frontend Development** 🖥️
- **Backend Development** ⚙️
- **Web Applications** 🌍
- **Databases** 🗃️
- **Code Architecture** & **Best Practices** 🏆

Writing and documenting things down is a powerful way for me to solidify my understanding of new concepts and ideas. I hope these blog posts can serve as a useful resource for fellow developers and act as a personal reference to look back on in the future. 📚

## Tech Stack 🛠️ 

This blog is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), built with the powerful combination of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The foundation of the site is based on the **Tailwind Next.js Starter Blog**, providing a minimal and efficient setup to get up and running quickly.

A special thanks to [Timothy Lin](https://twitter.com/timlrxx) for creating this lightweight, easy-to-customize starter blog. His work made it incredibly simple to tailor the design and functionality to suit my needs. 🙏

## What to Expect 🚀

- **Technical Articles**: I’ll be sharing my thoughts on technologies I work with or find interesting. 💡
- **Developer Journey**: Documenting my personal growth and learning process along the way. 📈
- **Projects**: Exploring full-stack solutions, code samples, and more as I continue to build and grow. 💻

I hope my contributions help other developers, especially those interested in full-stack development, improve their skills, and stay updated with best practices and emerging technologies. Let’s grow together! 🌟

## Future Goals 🎯

- More blog posts and tutorials to help fellow developers.
- Sharing detailed breakdowns of my personal projects and their code.
- Continuing to expand on my skills and explore new technologies.

Feel free to explore the repository, ask questions, and share your thoughts. Let's connect and learn together! 🤝
